This project is split into two sections, both focused on multithreading problems.
This first section is an inventory tracking system that tracks 4 office items,
which have different amounts of maximum you can have on hand at once, ie. only 50 pens,
once you reach 0 you must refresh the count to 50. There were 20 text files of varying size,
and at the end of reading all 20 files I provided the total counters for the items.

The second section was solving the dining philospher problem of synchronization issues,
aka deadlock. I implemented the resource hierarchy solution, giving each shared fork
a number and having the philsophers always eat the lowest value fork first.
